        <h2>Salazar Slytherin</h2>
        <p>
            The founder of Slytherin house. Sly and cunning, he was not unlike many of the ambitious students he brought into his house. He believed strongly that only witches and wizards of pure blood (i.e., those with a mother and father from wizarding families) should be allowed to attend Hogwarts. Slytherin caused great dispute over this with the other founders, and it eventually caused a permanent rift with Gryffindor, which led to Slytherin's departure from the school. Before he left, however, he created the Chamber of Secrets, complete with a huge statue of himself with a horrible monster lurking inside.<br>
          <br>
          Almost a thousand years later, Slytherin's descendant, Tom Riddle, would seek to fulfil his desires of banishing Muggle-borns from Hogwarts, and exterminating them.One of his personal effects, a locket, was later claimed by Voldemort, to be used as a Horcrux. He was the best friend of Godric Gryffindor before the rift occurred and he left Hogwarts. His house corresponds to the element of water.</p>
