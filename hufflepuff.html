        <h2>Helga Hufflepuff</h2>
        <p>
            The founder of Hufflepuff house. A kind and warm woman, she believed that, in order to be sorted into Hufflepuff house, a person must possess the values of loyalty, patience, and be hard-working above all else. However, unlike the other founders, who only took in students who possessed the traits they valued, Helga also took in all the other students who didn't fit in with any of the founders values. It is also known that she brought the house-elves to Hogwarts.
          <br>
          <br>She owned a fine golden cup which was fairly innocuous aside from being her possession. The cup was sought by Lord Voldemort nearly a thousand years later, for him to turn it into a Horcrux. She was the best friend of Rowena Ravenclaw. Her house corresponds to the element of earth.
